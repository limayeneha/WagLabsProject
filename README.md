# WagLabsProject

1. Followed MVVM architecture to develop  the project and have clear separation of concerns. 
2. Retrofit2 library as it makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON from a REST based webservice. 
   Also, used caching for storing network call results.
3. RxJava2 for reactive approach and to make code simple to maintain and easy to understand.
4. Picasso as image caching and loading library.
5. Databinding to minimize code in application logic to connect to the user interface elements.
